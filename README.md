# Energy-Price-Easy

The code aims to update the 'EasyEnergyPrice.csv' CSV file with the latest daily energy prices. It makes requests to an API to retrieve price data, processes the data, and adds it to the existing CSV file. The code checks if the dataset is up to date, retrieves the most recent and/or earliest data, performs data cleaning and formatting operations, and finally saves the updated DataFrame to the CSV file. This ensures that the file contains the latest daily energy prices, including any updates for previous dates.
